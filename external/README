# NOTES ON 'external' packages:

The current implementation of pathos required slight modifications
to three external dependencies. These dependencies are provided in the
`pathos.external` directory for users installing without setuptools.

To install the external packages:
    $ unzip pyre-0.8-pathos.zip
    $ unzip pp-1.6.4.2.zip
    $ unzip processing-0.52-pathos.zip
    $ cd processing-0.52-pathos
    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py install
    $ cd ../pp-1.6.4.2
    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py install
    $ cd ../pyre-0.8-pathos
    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py install


==================================================
DEVELOPER's NOTES:
==================================================

pyre & journal were built with:
$ cd pyre/branches/patches-from-jiao
$ mm zip4

the setup.py file was edited to *not* install .odb files

--------------------------------------------------

'pp' and 'processing' were edited to provide optional support
for dill (see notes in pp-1.6.4.2/README_MODS and
processing-0.52-pathos/README_MODS)
'pp' was edited to support python 3.x

--------------------------------------------------

UPDATE:

In attempt to merge hydra and pathos, pyre-0.8-pathos.zip
is replaced with pyre-0.8.2.0-pathos.zip, which is essentially
a modified version of CIG pythia-0.8.2.0. The .odb files are
installed. Installation is otherwise as above.  Changes:
 - migrated "ipc" from pythia-0.8-pathos
 - uncommented "pyre.ipc" in setup.py
 - changed version to "0.8.2.0-pathos"
 - use setuptools instead of distutils.core
 - renamed package "pyre" instead of "pythia"
