NOTES:
 - Tunnel deletes the launcher's ssh pid, but not the tunnel's pid
   (typically ssh pid + 1) --> could use "getpid" to grab it...
 - using "known_hosts" file to get $PROFILE is a temporary solution.
   Should use old gsl.infect (now pox) code to explore & find out,
   instead of relying on a user-built 'database'.
 - RPyC supposedly works for the existing code... check it out.
 - need to make edits to support "faregate" (see branches)
 - after above two bullets are satisfied, delete the appropriate branch ?


========== install_package ========================
notes:
  - failure on login.cacr.caltech.edu
    (won't source .cshrc)
  - partial success on shb-b.cacr.caltech.edu
    (sources .bash_profile; pp ok; but can't "use")
  - partial success on upgrayedd.danse.us [same on shc-c?]
    (sources .profile; pp ok; rpyc won't install from scratch)
